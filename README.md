# ansible_automation
My ansible playbooks and roles. Imperfect work-in-progress.

# Overview
This repo is predominantly playbooks and roles I wrote to manage Cisco network devices. All of it has been scrubbed, so some level of manual tweaking is required for the majority to work properly, ex the hosts group_/vars files, and vars in playbooks. A lot of these I often made and did not go back to and as a result may not be the most elegant solution to a problem, but are a solution nonetheless. Having said that, hopefully it helps you accomplish your goals, or provides a basis for you to work off of. 

Please raise an issue if something does not work properly. I do not plan on daily maitenance, but I will be sure to get around to things as I have time.
